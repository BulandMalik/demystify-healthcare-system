# Demystify Healthcare System

## What is Healthcare System?
A health system, health care system or healthcare system is an organization of people, institutions, and resources that delivers health care services to meet the health needs of target populations. -- ``Wikipedia``

``According to the World Health Organisation`` a health system consists of all organisations, people and actions whose primary intent is to promote, restore or maintain health. 

## What are Healthcare Models?
Health system models refer to the various structures and approaches used to organize and deliver healthcare services. These models can vary significantly from one country or region to another, and they are influenced by factors such as healthcare financing, government regulations, cultural norms, and the specific needs of the population. Here are some common health system models along with examples of countries that use them:

1. **Beveridge Model**: Named after the British economist William Beveridge, this model is often associated with the United Kingdom's National Health Service (NHS). In this model, healthcare is provided and funded by the government through taxation. Care is typically free at the point of use, and the government owns and operates most healthcare facilities. (Example: United Kingdom)

2. **Bismarck Model**: This model is commonly found in countries like Germany, France, and Japan. It relies on social insurance systems where both employers and employees make contributions to a healthcare fund. Healthcare providers are private, but the government heavily regulates and mandates insurance coverage. This model is sometimes called a "sickness fund" model. (Example: Germany)

3. **National Health Insurance Model**: In this model, the government collects taxes or premiums to fund a single-payer, national insurance system. Healthcare providers can be public or private. Canada and Taiwan are examples of countries that use variations of this model. (Example: Canada)

4. **Out-of-Pocket Model**: In regions with limited resources and infrastructure, healthcare services are often paid for directly by individuals. There is little or no government involvement or health insurance. This model can result in significant barriers to access for many people.

5. **Two-Tier Healthcare Model**: Some countries, like Canada, have a combination of a single-payer public system and a private healthcare system. The public system provides essential services, while individuals can purchase private insurance or pay out of pocket for additional care. (Example: Canada)

6. **Hybrid Healthcare Model**: This model combines elements of different systems. For example, the United States has a mixed healthcare system with public programs (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid), private health insurance, and out-of-pocket payments.

7. **Community Health Model**: In this approach, care is delivered primarily through community-based health centers and clinics. It focuses on preventive and primary care services and is often used in low-resource settings.

8. **Managed Care Model**: Managed care organizations, such as Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) and Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs), emphasize cost control and coordination of care. These models are often used in the United States.

9. **Telehealth and E-Health Models**: With the advancement of technology, healthcare systems are increasingly incorporating telehealth and e-health services, allowing patients to access care remotely.

10. **Universal Healthcare Model**: The goal of universal healthcare is to ensure that all residents of a country have access to essential healthcare services without facing financial hardship. Various models, including those mentioned above, can be used to achieve universal healthcare.

It's important to note that there are ongoing debates and discussions about which health system model is most effective and equitable. The choice of a model often depends on a country's economic resources, political decisions, and the values of its citizens. Health system models are dynamic, and countries may evolve or adapt their systems over time in response to changing needs and circumstances.

## EHR vs EMR
**EMR (Electronic Medical Record)** and **EHR (Electronic Health Record)** are both electronic systems for managing health records, but they serve different purposes and have distinct features:

### EMR (Electronic Medical Record)

1. **Scope**: EMR systems are designed for use within a single medical practice, clinic, or hospital. They focus on the patient's medical and treatment history within that specific facility.

2. **Functionality**: EMRs are primarily concerned with clinical data and medical history. They include patient demographics, medical history, diagnoses, medications, treatment plans, and test results. They are a digital version of a patient's paper chart.

3. **Data Entry**: EMRs are usually created for and used by healthcare providers, such as physicians and nurses. They are essential for recording patient interactions and clinical decisions.

4. **Interoperability**: EMRs may have limited interoperability with other healthcare systems. Sharing patient information with other institutions or providers can be challenging.

5. **Ownership**: The EMR is typically owned and maintained by the healthcare facility where it is implemented.

### EHR (Electronic Health Record)

1. **Scope**: EHR systems are designed to contain a patient's health information from multiple medical practices, clinics, or hospitals. They provide a comprehensive view of a patient's health history across different healthcare settings.

2. **Functionality**: EHRs include not only clinical data but also a broader range of patient information, including medical history, allergies, immunization records, radiology images, and even data from patient portals. They are designed to be more comprehensive than EMRs.

3. **Data Entry**: EHRs are intended for use by healthcare providers but also aim to involve patients in their healthcare. Patients can access their EHRs and contribute to them, enhancing patient engagement.

4. **Interoperability**: EHRs prioritize interoperability. They aim to facilitate the exchange of health information between different healthcare providers and organizations, improving care coordination.

5. **Ownership**: EHRs are often maintained by health systems, hospitals, or regional health information organizations and may be accessible by authorized providers across various facilities.

In summary, EMRs are focused on clinical data within a single healthcare facility, while EHRs aim to provide a more comprehensive, interoperable view of a patient's health information across multiple settings. EHRs have a broader scope and are designed to facilitate improved patient care coordination and engagement. The choice between EMR and EHR depends on the specific needs and goals of the healthcare organization or practice.
